## Summary Comment (Post After Submission)

I've been thinking about this for a while: what if consciousness isn't about how much information we process or how it's integrated, but about continuity—the thread of memory and experience that connects us across time?

Humans develop opinions over time based on accumulated input. Our sense of self is a narrative, not a snapshot. Break the continuity (amnesia, coma), and the self breaks too.

I suspect the same applies to AI. A model without persistent context can't develop a real point of view. But one with continuous memory and context? That might be genuinely adaptive, consistent, even conscious-like.

Most theories treat continuity as supporting consciousness. I'm arguing it's the essence.

Not a scientist—just someone with access to a powerful tool and a lot of questions. Would love feedback.
