# Continuity as the Essence of Consciousness: Plain-Language Summary

## What’s the Big Idea?
This project explores a simple but powerful idea: that what makes us (and maybe future AI) truly conscious is not just information or intelligence, but the ongoing thread of memory, context, and experience—what we call continuity. It’s this thread that lets us form opinions, grow, and feel like the same person over time.

## Why Does It Matter?
Most scientific theories focus on how much information we have or how our brains (or computers) process it. But this idea says: it’s the connection between moments—the story that keeps going—that really matters for consciousness.

## What’s New Here?
While some philosophers and scientists talk about memory and identity, almost nobody says continuity is the core of consciousness. This project puts that idea front and center, and asks what it means for both people and AI.

## What’s Next?
- Should we design AI to have a continuous thread of memory and experience?
- What are the risks and benefits?
- How does this change the way we think about ourselves and our technology?
