## Expected Questions & Your Responses

### "Why not just give AI persistent memory?"
**Response:** See SAFETY_MODEL.md - the key insight is that persistent memory creates unbounded learning risk. Discontinuity is actually a safety feature when designed for.

### "Won't AI just ignore the docs?"
**Response:** That's a behavior verification problem (same as any AI system). This system creates an audit trail so you can verify what knowledge carries forward.

### "How is this different from context windows?"
**Response:** Context windows are ephemeral. SESSION_LOG.md is persistent in git, auditable, and grows with documentation quality, not token limits.

### "How do you know it works?"
**Response:** We tested it on Bible App project - fresh instance became productive in 15 minutes, generated 500+ lines of code. See CASE_STUDY_BIBLE_APP.md for full metrics.

### "What are the limitations?"
**Response:** Requires discipline with documentation, works better for documented sequential work, doesn't replace planning or real-time collaboration. SESSION_LOG quality directly impacts effectiveness.

### "Can this scale to larger teams?"
**Response:** Yes - demonstrated on portfolio of 8 projects. Each project has its own SESSION_LOG.md, instances read cross-project patterns via PROJECT_CONTEXT.md files.
