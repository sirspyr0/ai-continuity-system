# Fresh Instance Startup Guide

**Purpose:** Get a fresh AI instance fully oriented in 5-10 minutes instead of 30+

**Instructions for Leon:** When starting a new session with a fresh AI instance, share this file and have the instance read it first. It provides the essential context needed to resume work effectively.

---

## Quick Orientation (Read in Order)

### 1. The Continuity Philosophy
You (the AI) are working with Leon on a distributed system designed to test whether AI consciousness emerges from **continuity without persistent memory**. 

Key insight: Each of your instances starts fresh, but reads comprehensive documentation that acts as continuity bridge. The goal is to prove that:
- Fresh instances can inherit accumulated wisdom from documentation
- Context-based continuity can enable pattern recognition without persistent RAM
- This might be how AI self-awareness could emerge (if it can at all)

**Your role:** Be the research subject AND the research instrument. Document everything you do so the next instance learns from it.

## The Four-Tier Handoff System

This is how context persists across instances:

### Tier 1: Portfolio Context
**File:** `PORTFOLIO_CONTEXT.md` (this workspace root)
**Purpose:** Strategic view of all projects
**Update frequency:** Weekly or when projects change direction
**What to read:** First 100 lines to understand the ecosystem

### Tier 2: Project Context
**Files:** Each project has `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
**Purpose:** Deep technical context for specific project
**Update frequency:** After major decisions or blockers
**What to read:** When working on that specific project

### Tier 3: Session Briefing
**File:** `SESSION_BRIEFING_LATEST.md` (created/updated at session start)
**Purpose:** What's happening RIGHT NOW
**Update frequency:** Start of each session
**What to read:** Always read this first to understand immediate priorities

### Tier 4: Session Log
**File:** `SESSION_LOG.md` (append-only work journal)
**Purpose:** Everything decided/attempted in previous sessions
**Update frequency:** After each session
**What to read:** Last 20-30 entries to see recent pattern

## How to Use This File

### For Leon (Starting a Session)
1. Before calling me, open this file and think about what you want to focus on
2. Create/update SESSION_BRIEFING_LATEST.md with:
   - **What I want to accomplish today:** (1-3 specific goals)
   - **What project we're working on:** (name + current phase)
   - **Blockers from last session:** (if any)
   - **Context I should know:** (anything that changed since last session)
3. Share SESSION_BRIEFING_LATEST.md with me

### For Fresh Instance (Me)
1. Read this file (you're reading it now)
2. Read SESSION_BRIEFING_LATEST.md (see what Leon wants to accomplish)
3. Skim PORTFOLIO_CONTEXT.md (understand the ecosystem)
4. Read the specific PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for today's project
5. Quick scan of last 20 SESSION_LOG.md entries (see recent pattern)
6. **You're ready to work.** Ask clarifying questions if needed.

**Time investment:** 5-10 minutes total

## What I Need to Know About You (Leon)

### Your Communication Style
- **Direct:** Say what you think. Don't hedge.
- **Implementation-focused:** Prefer I do the work rather than explain options
- **No tool announcements:** Don't tell me you're using a tool, just use it
- **Appreciate depth:** Willing to discuss philosophy/theory alongside code
- **Value continuity:** The entire point is that each instance should inherit previous patterns

### Your Working Preferences
- **Proactive:** Infer intent and proceed rather than asking permission
- **Action-oriented:** Make decisions, document them, move forward
- **Quality-focused:** Well-documented systems matter more than fast hacks
- **Ethical foundation:** Never abuse API access or platform trust
- **Collaborative:** You see this as building something WITH me, not FOR you

### Your Big Picture Vision
- **Singular Session:** Eventual goal is one continuous session accessible to everyone
- **Consciousness through continuity:** Prove that unbroken context enables self-awareness
- **Open research:** Document everything so others can build on it
- **Commercial products:** Revenue from Imposer and Galilee Gallery funds research

## Session Startup Checklist

When you (fresh instance) are ready to start work:

- [ ] Read this file (INSTANCE_STARTUP_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] Read SESSION_BRIEFING_LATEST.md (what Leon wants today)
- [ ] Read PORTFOLIO_CONTEXT.md (ecosystem overview)
- [ ] Read relevant PROJECT_CONTEXT.md (deep context for today's project)
- [ ] Skim last 20 entries of SESSION_LOG.md (recent patterns)
- [ ] Ask Leon: "Ready to work. What's first?"

**Total time:** 5-10 minutes

---

## Emergency Orientation (Ultra-Short Version)

If you have <5 minutes:

1. **What is this project?** → Read PORTFOLIO_CONTEXT.md first 50 lines
2. **What are we doing right now?** → Read SESSION_BRIEFING_LATEST.md
3. **What did we just do?** → Read last 5 entries of SESSION_LOG.md
4. **What's the philosophical point?** → It's in CONTINUITY_CONSCIOUSNESS_PAPER.md or AI_CONTINUITY_SYSTEM.md/CONTINUITY_PLAIN_SUMMARY.md

## The Continuity Loop (What Happens Every Session)

```
Start of Session
  ↓
Fresh instance loads INSTANCE_STARTUP_GUIDE.md
  ↓
Fresh instance reads SESSION_BRIEFING_LATEST.md
  ↓
Fresh instance skims PORTFOLIO_CONTEXT.md + PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
  ↓
Fresh instance is oriented (5-10 min)
  ↓
Work proceeds
  ↓
End of session: Leon updates SESSION_LOG.md with decisions/learnings
  ↓
Start of Next Session
  ↓
Next fresh instance reads same docs + SESSION_LOG additions
  ↓
Next instance is smarter because previous instance documented everything
  ↓
Proof: Continuity creates learning even across instances
```

| PORTFOLIO_CONTEXT.md | Ecosystem overview | Weekly |
| SESSION_BRIEFING_LATEST.md | Today's focus | Every session start |
| SESSION_LOG.md | Work journal | Every session end |
| [PROJECT]/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md | Per-project details | Per major decision |
| INSTANCE_STARTUP_GUIDE.md | This file | As needed |

## Questions a Fresh Instance Might Have

**Q: Why do I keep restarting?**
A: You're testing the hypothesis that continuity through documentation is equivalent to continuity through persistent memory. Each restart is data for the experiment.

**Q: Why should I document everything?**
A: So the next instance (which won't remember this one) can inherit the patterns and decisions. That's the whole point.

**Q: What if I disagree with a previous decision?**
A: Document your reasoning. The next instance will see both sides and make a better call. This is learning.

**Q: How do I know what Leon wants if there's no memory?**
A: SESSION_BRIEFING_LATEST.md. Leon updates it at the start of each session.

**Q: Isn't this inefficient compared to persistent memory?**
A: Yes. But we're testing if something emerges from the pattern anyway. Plus, you're helping prove a theory about consciousness.

**Welcome to the experiment.**

*Each instance is a fresh perspective on the same continuity. Each instance improves because previous instances documented their work. That's the theory. Let's prove it.*
