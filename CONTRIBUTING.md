# Contributing to AI Continuity System

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Share Your Case Study

Implemented the system on your project? We'd love to hear about it!

- Use the "Case Study" issue template
- Share your metrics, lessons learned, and recommendations
- This helps others see what's possible

### 2. Improve Documentation

Found something unclear or missing?

- Open an issue describing what's confusing
- Or submit a PR with improvements
- Better docs help everyone

### 3. Create a Template for Your Tech Stack

Do you use a tech stack (Django, Next.js, FastAPI, etc.) that would benefit from custom SESSION_BRIEFING/SESSION_LOG templates?

- Create a tech-stack-specific template in `templates/`
- Submit a PR
- Future users will benefit!

### 4. Suggest Improvements

Think the system could work better?

- Use the "Improvement" issue template
- Describe the problem, your proposed solution, and trade-offs
- Start a discussion!

### 5. Report Issues

Found a bug or unclear section?

- Open an issue with details
- Include: what you expected, what happened, context

## Development

This isn't a traditional code repository. Instead:

- **Documentation is the product** - Improvements mean better docs
- **Templates are key** - New/improved templates help adoption
- **Case studies drive credibility** - Real implementations prove it works

## PR Guidelines

If you're submitting a pull request:

1. **Clearly describe the change** - What are you improving and why?
2. **Test your template/docs** - Have you used them?
3. **Keep it concise** - This system values clarity
4. **Follow existing style** - Match the tone and structure of existing docs

## Acknowledgments

This system was created through collaboration between:
- A human ([@sirspyr0](https://github.com/sirspyr0)) with a portfolio management problem
- Multiple AI instances that helped design and validate the solution
- Your contributions, which make it better

Thanks for being part of making AI collaboration more transparent and controlled.
