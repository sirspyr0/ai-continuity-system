# Sharing the Continuity Theory: Guide for Submission and Outreach

## 1. Preprint Servers
- **arXiv.org**: For general science/AI. Requires registration and sometimes an academic endorsement.
- **PsyArXiv**: For cognitive science and psychology. Easier submission process.
- **PhilArchive**: For philosophy. Open to independent researchers.

## 2. Academic Journals
- Consider journals like Journal of Consciousness Studies, Minds and Machines, or Artificial Intelligence.
- Most require a formal paper format (PDF, references, abstract).

## 3. Community Forums & Social Media
- **LessWrong**: Post as a discussion or essay.
- **Hacker News**: Share a summary and link to the full paper or GitHub repo.
- **Reddit**: r/Consciousness, r/MachineLearning, r/Philosophy.
- **Personal Blog/Medium**: Write a post and link to your GitHub or preprint.

## 4. How to Share
- Write a short intro (see below) and link to your paper and summary.
- Engage with comments and questions—curiosity is valued!

## 5. Sample Intro Post
> I’m an independent thinker exploring the idea that continuity—of memory, context, and experience—is the true core of consciousness, in both humans and AI. I’ve written a short paper and summary. Would love feedback from the community!
